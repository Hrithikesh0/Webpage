function The(){
    document.getElementById("Div").innerHTML = `<div style="color: white;" class="container">He was an intelligent and notorious devil emerged directly from the depths of nightmares. Gifted with the ability to escape capture for decades, if not for a particular day, he would have never been recorded into the crime records. The dreadful challenge to the crime squad department was that his targets were exposed to the world before he began his hunt, a deadly and dangerous game. 
Crime Department’s duty was to protect them from his clutches. To their misery, the death of a famed Godman shocks the nation.

The horrors inside his mind spilled into the world and into the ordinary lives of those 5 random individuals, without any recognizable pattern or logic, until his motives were exposed by a crime squad officer by tracing and decrypting every piece of puzzle at microscopic close.

He kills, not for passion, fun or revenge, but for a definite mysterious goal. After each assassination, a dark secret surface creating shockwaves from the clues of his letters. He justifies his assassinations by claiming they are destined to happen, with links to many incidents, starting from the very inception of the world, Vedic writings, Ramayana and Mahabharata, to the present-day Yuga.

Were these deaths linked to Godman? Was he a serial Killer or Psychopath or Avatar? Was the crime force successful in hunting that Invincible Assassin finally?

function When(){
    document.getElementById("Div").innerHTML =`<div style="color: white;" class="container">In a major car crash, Detective Nicholas Thomas loses his wife, Sophie. He is left crippled, confined to a wheelchair, with his memory erased. Once a smart detective, he is now helpless and eccentric.

When browsing through his dead wife's private room, he stumbles upon an intriguing painting which makes him realize that Sophie had been having a secret affair with an unknown person.
Challenged by the mystery, he swears to rebuild his memories with the help of a loyal friend.

Nicholas begins his hunt for Sophie's mysterious lover. The only challenge is, with his mind wiped clean, he has no idea where to start.

As he digs deeper into the mystery, it seems that the mysterious adversary is doing everything to stall and block his findings. The more he goes into the mystery, the farther the adversary seems to be.

Nicholas' memory may be gone, but will his steely determination see him through?

"Wrong number…" Her voice was familiar. She disconnected the call. Later, the number was out of the service, and then her email was bounced.
Is her friendship through the internet was for fun or mischief or just a hoax?
The eternal bonding between a grownup boy and little girl was disconnected for unknown reasons.
Will he find the reason behind her unexpected action, or will he hate her and lead his life with his girlfriend, or will nature give him any hints?
